# Face Recognition Challenge
HOG feature extraction technique has been used in order to achieve this task.
# Approach 
Steps to implement nueral style transfer
> Resizing the Image
> Calculating Gradients
> Calculating the Magnitudegrad G(x,y) = ((dg/dy)^2 + (dg/dx)^2)^(1/2)
> Calculationg the graident angle
> Resizing the image
> Using hog() function from scikit-image library, giving it the six necessary parameters to calculate the
histogram of gradients and itâ€™s parameters.

# Execution
> Add the image you want to compare and you'd get the result schematics
