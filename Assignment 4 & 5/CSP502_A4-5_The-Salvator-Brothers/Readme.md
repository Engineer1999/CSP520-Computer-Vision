 # Citrus Leaf Classification with CNN

Steps for classification:

1. 
2.
3.

## Requirements

This code requires you have _________________ or greater installed. Please see the `requirements.txt` file. To ensure you're up to date, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You must also have __________________ installed in order to ______________-.

## Getting the data

First, download the dataset from _______ into the `data` folder:

`cd data && wget https://data.mendeley.com/public-files/datasets/3f83gxmv57/files/53398b67-6f0e-4a67-8384-e2b574b2ebf4/file_downloaded`

Then extract it with `unzip -v Citrus.zip`.

## Training models


## Blah blah

I have not yet implemented a demo where you can pass a video file to a model and get a prediction. Pull requests are welcome if you'd like to help out!

## TODO

- [ ] Add data augmentation to fight overfitting
- [x] Support multiple workers in the data generator for faster training
- [ ] Add a demo script
- [ ] Support other datasets
- [ ] Implement optical flow
- [ ] Implement more complex network architectures, like optical flow/CNN fusion
